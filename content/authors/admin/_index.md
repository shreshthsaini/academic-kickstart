I am a PhD student at the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering ([LIVE](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/)) at University of Texas at Austin. I am advised bt Professor Alan C Bovik. My current research focus is on computer vision, deep learning, and high dynamic range video content. 

Before this, I have worked as Research Engineer/Machine Learning Engineer at [BioMind](https://biomind.ai/), Singapore and as Research Engineer - AI at [Arkray, Inc.](http://www.arkray.co.jp/english/). Where I worked on developing industry leading medical AI solutions. Notably, I have been working on challenging pathological datasets to develope highly reliable and light deep learning models which could be deployed on devices like [Aution-Eye](http://www.arkray.co.jp/english/products/laboratory/urinalysis_analyzers/ai-4510.html). 

My research interest is highly interdisciplinary covering machine learning, computer vision, video engineering,medical image analysis, and healthcare informatics. I am tinkering around MLOps more recently, I welcome any suggestion and/or guidance. I occasionally work on deep learning applications in biometrics **(fact: I started my research journey from this field).**

I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institue of Technology, Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/) in 2020. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Mengling 'Mornin' Feng](https://mornin-feng.com) at Healthcare AI group, National University of Singapore(NUS). During my undergrad, I was actively working with [Dr. Anil Kumar Tiwari](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~akt/), [Dr. Rajendra Nagar](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~rn/), and [Dr. Deepak Mishra](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~dmishra/) in biomedical and healtcare analytics, and computer vision. I am eternally greatful to [Dr. Aditya Nigam](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~aditya/), who identified and steered my research interest early in my undergrad.
