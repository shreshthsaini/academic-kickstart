I am Shreshth Saini, recently completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institue of Technology - Jodhpur](iitj.ac.in). My research interests are highly interdisciplinary covering machine learning in general, application of deep learning in medical image analysis, biometrics and computer vision. I also work with memory based approaches for finacial data analysis. For a while, i have been trying to shift my focus towards unsupervised & reinforcement learnings.

Currently, I am working as a Research Engineer(AI). I have been working with [Dr. Mengling 'Mornin'](https://mornin-feng.com) Feng on skin cancer analysis using deep learning. At IIT Jodhpur, I had been actively working with [Dr. Anil Kumar Tiwari](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~akt/) on multiple projects of which two notable were Segmentation of left atrium cavity in patients affected by atrial fibrillation and Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy using AI and [Dr. Rajendra Nagar](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~rn/) on Image Super resolution and X-ray image Analysis. I also had the opportunity of woking with [Dr. Aditya Nigam](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~aditya/) on application of deep learning in biometrics during my early days of exposure to the field of Deep learning and Applications.
